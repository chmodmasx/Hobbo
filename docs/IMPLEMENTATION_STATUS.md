# Implementation status

## Bootstrap completed

- [x] Public repository initialized.
- [x] Architecture baseline documented.
- [x] Procedural Sprite Forge architecture documented.
- [x] Baseline GGUF models locked with SHA256.
- [x] Verified model download script added.
- [x] Granite schema-constrained smoke test added.
- [x] Nomic embeddings smoke test added.
- [x] Monorepo workspace initialized.
- [x] GitHub Actions model smoke workflow green on `ubuntu-latest` with real Q4_K_M GGUFs.

### Verified model contract

- Cognition: Granite 4.1 3B Q4_K_M through pinned llama.cpp commit `6011c34ce6099646ccdf0d39a61c6e681477c178`.
- Schema-constrained decision returned `affordance_id=eat_owned_food` for the deterministic hunger fixture.
- Embeddings: Nomic Embed Text v2 MoE Q4_K_M through llama.cpp's OpenAI-compatible embeddings endpoint.
- Embedding dimensionality observed in CI: 768.
- Model weights and the pinned llama.cpp CPU build are restored from GitHub Actions cache on subsequent runs.

## Deterministic core completed

- [x] Domain types package.
- [x] Deterministic bigint world clock with no wall-clock dependency.
- [x] Stable scheduled-event priority queue and deterministic scheduler.
- [x] Domain-event envelope, append-only in-memory log and replay primitives.
- [x] Shared action registry/validator for player, rule, utility, LLM and replay origins.
- [x] Deterministic mock cognitive provider.
- [x] Replay cognitive provider that never silently re-infers missing decisions.
- [x] Initial PostgreSQL migration for worlds, domain events, scheduled events and cognition runs.
- [x] PostgreSQL migration smoke test on a real PostgreSQL 17 service in GitHub Actions.
- [x] Strict TypeScript core CI green with 14 unit tests.

### Core invariants currently enforced

- Simulation time cannot move backwards.
- Events scheduled for the same simulation time execute in stable insertion order.
- Handlers may schedule additional work at the current simulation time without reordering earlier queued work.
- Event history uses contiguous sequence numbers and nondecreasing simulation time.
- Duplicate event and scheduled-event identifiers are rejected.
- Player and AI action requests pass through the same action validation rules.
- Cognitive providers cannot invent affordances not supplied by the simulation.
- Replay cognition fails on missing or no-longer-valid recorded decisions rather than calling a model.
- PostgreSQL rejects negative simulation time and invalid scheduler states.

## Next implementation milestones

- [ ] Property-based world invariants.
- [ ] Minimal physiology/food/inventory domain slice.
- [ ] Headless 20-agent simulation fixture.
- [ ] Deterministic seed/random stream abstraction.
- [ ] Persistence repositories/transactions over the core schema.
- [ ] Minimal Sprite Forge Blender fixture.

The project should not begin large-scale visual/content work before the headless simulation gates are met.
